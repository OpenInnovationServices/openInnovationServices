        <h6 class="display-5">What is The Graduate&nbsp;Innovation Experience from Open Innovation Services?</h6>

        <p>The Graduate Innovation Experience from Open is a fast-track on-demand programme designed to help your
          motivated, digital-savvy graduates become future leaders.&nbsp;Open facilitates graduates to practice creative
          problem-solving on real-world issues in your business using proven design thinking and business model tools.
        </p>

        <h6 class="display-5">Why should I sponsor our graduates&nbsp;to participate?</h6>

        <p>In the short-term you get a demonstrable return on investment on the problems they solve. Grads&nbsp;also
          develop the capability to creatively problem-solve on a continual basis. Over time these experiences will help
          to build a culture of innovation that will ensure your business delivers long-term sustainable profits for
          your shareholders.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">Why should my graduates volunteer to participate?</h6>

        <p>The Graduate Innovation Experience reveals and unleashes your&nbsp;talented grads to foster their
          entrepreneurial mindset, to gain the excitement and inspiration we feel when we are empowered to create the
          future; the products, services, promises, processes, business models and organisations of tomorrow. The
          programme encourages prospective leaders to learn and develop key 21st century skills as individuals and teams
          in a highly collaborative virtual lab.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">What issues, problems or opportunities do teams typically tackle?</h6>

        <p>Past examples include developing new revenue and growth streams, faster execution cycles, cost reduction,
          improving customer service, leveraging emerging tech, HR issues, other process re-engineering, any opportunity
          to improve &ndash; it&rsquo;s up to you to decide what is most important to your business.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How do we choose the issues for my business to tackle?</h6>

        <p>You decide on the issues that are important in your business. We have extensive experience helping
          organisations choose the key problems and opportunities and are on-hand to help you.</p>
        <a href="#" id="return-top1"><img alt="Scroll to top" class="img-fluid" id="up-arrow-img"
            src="image/scroll_top.png" /></a>

        <h1 class="display-5  text-center q2" id="td">The Deliverables</h1>

        <h6 class="display-5">Why are Design Thinking and Business Model Innovation methods used?</h6>

        <p>They are the two most widely used proven innovation approaches used by businesses today. IDEO and Stanford
          d.school brought design thinking to a global audience and Business Model Innovation was developed by Alexander
          Ostewalder at University of Lausanne.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How do teams discover what customers and stakeholders want?</h6>

        <p>They engage in Observation, Conversation and Search to gain insights into stakeholder&#39;s problems and
          aspirations.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">What types of prototypes do teams typically make?</h6>

        <p>Teams bring ideas to life by making prototypes including explainer videos, landing pages, apps, data sheets,
          brochures, physical mockups, product box and conceriege MVPs.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How do teams test the wider business model for their solution?</h6>

        <p>Teams evaluate the business aspects of their proposed solutions using the 9 key building blocks of the
          Business Model Canvas.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How do teams test or experiment with their ideas?</h6>

        <p>Teams conduct both user action experiments and sales tests to measure the desirability, feasibility and
          viability of their ideas. Crucially they iterate using the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">Tell me about the team pitches?</h6>

        <p>Teams generally deliver a circa. 6 minute pitch plus 4 minute Q&amp;As live in front of colleagues and senior
          managers or via live streaming - whichever suits your business best.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">What happens after the pitches?</h6>

        <p>During the pitch, teams ask internal sponsors for extra resources to get to the next stage-gate. The sponsors
          decide whether to allocate this &lsquo;metered funding&rsquo; or not.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">Are there winners, awards, badges?</h6>

        <p>That&rsquo;s up to you. We recommend winners, awards and badges.</p>
        <a href="#" id="return-top2"><img alt="Scroll to top" class="img-fluid" id="up-arrow-img"
            src="image/scroll_top.png" /></a>

        <h1 class="display-5 text-center q3" id="tc">The Commitments</h1>

        <h6 class="display-5">How many graduates&nbsp;can take The Innovation Experience?</h6>

        <p>Graduates participate in either self-formed or selected teams of 4. The minimum number required to create
          energy and enthusiasm is 3 teams of 4 or 12 participants. The maximum is 10 teams of 4 or 40 volunteer
          innovators. Diverse teams perform best so consider a blend of gender, culture, attitudes, interests and
          opinions.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How much time commitment is involved for participants?</h6>

        <p>The Innovation Experience is designed to fit into the busy schedules of grads&nbsp;over a 10 week period. It
          requires participants to invest about 4 hours per week at times and places and on devices that suit their
          creative flow, when they have that feeling of energised focus and enjoyment in the process of problem-solving.
        </p>

        <h6 class="display-5">What is the role of mentors?</h6>

        <p>Our mentors&nbsp;provide personalised online feedback to and interaction with all of the teams all the way
          through the 10 week programme. The mentors&nbsp;are experienced entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs with proven
          track records in delivering successful innovation ventures. They ensure teams stay on-track, offering guidance
          on the innovation philosophy, tools and techniques as well as the effectiveness of the collaboration effort.
          They encourage teams to be agile and adaptive and to move through the process in rapid iteration cycles.
          Mentors&nbsp;push teams to produce results. They also support members to foster a growth mindset, to grow
          emotionally as individuals and teams to achieve outcomes that are of value to the firm.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">What is the role of subject experts?</h6>

        <p>Subject experts are optional but recommended. They are internal managers in your organisation who have
          in-depth knowledge and experience in the domain that they are providing expertise on.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How much does the programme cost?</h6>

        <p>Rates vary&nbsp;depending on the number of participants.&nbsp;Remember, participants continue to focus on
          their day jobs and&nbsp;there is zero travel &amp; expenses, unlike with&nbsp;in-person courses.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">When does the programme start?</h6>

        <p>Any time you wish. We&rsquo;re flexible to your needs.</p>

        <h1 class="display-5 text-center q4" id="odm">The On-Demand Platform</h1>

        <h6 class="display-5">Tell me about the on-demand platform?</h6>

        <h1 class="display-5 text-center q5" id="tpm">Programme Measurement</h1>

        <h6 class="display-5">How is programme success measured?</h6>

        <p>The two measurements are learning outcomes and ROI.</p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How is ROI measured?</h6>

        <p>The value created by the teams is measured using a widely accepted technique called Innovation Accounting.
        </p>

        <h6 class="display-5">How are Learning Outcomes measured?</h6>

        <p>Our analytics engine provides managers with a view to see and understand the learning experience for the
          organisation, the team and the graduate. The platform delivers data on what learners watched or read and when,
          what challenges or assignments they completed and when as well as how they engaged with the content, the
          collaboration tools and the gamification elements. The coaches feedback to each of the teams regarding each of
          the challenges along with other interventions are also analysed and shared with senior managers. This gives
          decision-makers the ability to fully measure and evaluate the effectiveness of the experience.</p>
